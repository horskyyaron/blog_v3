Hello! I'm Yaron 😃

I work as a software engineer at Moveo.\
BS.c in computer science.

I'm a funny guy who likes to cook, program, watch anime, read books \
(at least aspiring to), and overall enjoy life.

This is just a big rubber-duck debugging experiment.\
It's an attempt to clarify my thoughts and solidify my learning.\
I find the idea that if you can't truly describe something in your own words, you don't \
really understand it — at least not at a deep level — to be true.

Thus, this little piece of software was born.
