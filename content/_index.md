My name is Yaron 😃 \
I'm a funny guy which likes to cook, program, watch anime, read books (at \
least aspiring to) and overall to enjoy life.

This is just a big rubber duck debugging experiment.\
Its an attempt to clarify my thoughts and solidify my learnings. \
I find the idea that - if you can't really describe something in your own words, \
you don't really understand it, at least not at a deep level - to be true.

Thus, this little piece of software was born.
