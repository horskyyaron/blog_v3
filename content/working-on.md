Some cool stuff I'm doing:

## yaronhorsky.com

This website :)\
I've danced around this idea for some time now and decided to pull the trigger.\
You are not that important, what is the worst that can happen?

<!-- ## lazymux  -->
<!---->
<!---->
<!-- [Lazymux](https://github.com/horskyyaron/lazymux) is a TUI for managing your TMUX sessions for your projects.\ -->
<!-- Will be using [openTui](https://github.com/sst/opentui/tree/main) for building the ui.  -->

<!-- ## TBTUI  -->
<!---->
<!-- Time-block TUI. \ -->
<!-- Time block planner for the digital platform.\ -->
<!-- Thoughts: schedule, have reminders using cron jobs, modify schedule, track metrics\ -->
<!-- notes, block types (meeting, errands) -->


<!-- ## YWS -->

<!-- The Goal: creating a local "aws-ish" so I can play with these tools locally before -->
<!-- using the cloud environment. -->
<!-- This project is built mainly with Python. -->
