Some cool stuff I'm doing:

## yaronhorsky.com

This website :)\
I've danced around this idea for some time now and decided to pull the trigger.\
You are not that important, what is the worst that can happen?

## Tmux-sessionizer TUI

A project management TUI.
Quick navigation, and creation of projects

## YWS

The Goal: creating a local "aws-ish" so I can play with these tools locally before
using the cloud environment.
This project is built mainly with Python.
