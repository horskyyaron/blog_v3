Some cool stuff I'm doing:

## yaronhorsky.com

This website :)\
I've danced around this idea for some time now and decided to pull the trigger.\
You are not that important, what is the worst that can happen?

## YWS

The Goal: creating a local "aws-ish" so i can play with these tools locally before "committing"
to the tools in the cloud which costs money.

Why?
This will help me learn about these subjects, implementing and creating is the best way to learn.
Also, very fun.

Besides learning about how microservice works and communicate, I'll also be using
Python so I'll become proficient in another language.
